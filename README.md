A risk loan dataset, https://bigml.com/dashboard/dataset/577bdcd477920c1ba40009a6, is to be used to predict the risk quality of a loan application. There are 1,000 noisy instances using 10 categorical attributes, divided into three files called examples1.txt, examples2.txt and examples3.txt. Each instance is classified as either good (class label G) or bad (class label B), so this is a 2-class classification problem. You can assume other datasets used for testing will also be 2-class classification tasks with categorical attributes. The data has 10 attributes.
